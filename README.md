# A Fake Company Management App
This app manages companies by showing a list of current companies pulled from the database on housed on Firestore. The user 
can see each company by clicking on the eye icon. Once in the company profile, the user can go back, edit, or delete the document 
for that company. There is also a feature to add a new company. In the future, I could make this more robust by adding a login 
(also from Firebase), and sorting/searching functionality as well as testing.
